text -> The tone of this document is Casual. This can be determined by several elements:

1. The informal greeting "Hi Bob"
2. The personal references (e.g., "It was great seeing you and Sheryl last week")
3. The mention of social interaction (the BBQ)
4. The conversational language used throughout (e.g., "let me explain how this letter works")
5. The informal phrasing like "what's going on with your finances"
6. The use of contractions (e.g., "I'm," "it's")

While the letter does have some formal elements (like the business address header and "RE:" line), the overall tone is deliberately casual and friendly, aiming to make the financial discussion more approachable and personal. The writer clearly has a familiar relationship with the recipient and chooses to maintain this informal tone throughout the communication.
